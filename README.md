 Blockchain-based Automated Market Maker (AMM)

For those unfamiliar with Blockchain applications, see the "contracts" folder for the source code.

Automated market makers regulate trade rates and automate the trade process, returning trading
fees to those providing the liquidity. In Blockchain applications, anybody can be a provider
of liquidity with any amount, small or large.  This is a mock application that in theory does
just that. The idea isn't novel, but the creation of it helped me learn a lot about how they
work, and how that application is represented in the Solidity language.
